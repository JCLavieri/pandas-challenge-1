# Data Analysis Challenge: E-Commerce Company

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a fictional e-commerce company's dataset using Python's Pandas library. The primary objective is to explore, transform, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights. Key tasks include identifying top customers, analyzing popular product categories, calculating profits, and more.

## Objectives

- **Data Transformation**: Create additional columns to calculate subtotal, shipping price, total price, cost, and profit for each transaction.
- **Data Confirmation**: Verify the calculations against provided order total prices.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to find total expenditures, revenues, and profits for the top 5 clients and summarize the findings.
